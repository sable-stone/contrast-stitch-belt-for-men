                <h2>What is a Contrast Stitch Belt?</h2>
                <p>Let's start with the basics. A belt is a strip of material, like leather, that you wear around your waist. It holds up your pants. A Contrast Stitch Belt is a leather belt with stitching in a different color.</p>
                <p>For example, a brown leather belt with white stitching. Or a black leather belt with tan stitching. This stitching is the "contrast." It is a small detail. But it makes the belt look more interesting and well-made. It shows that someone took the time to create something beautiful and strong.</p>

                        <h3>Keep it Dry</h3>
                        <p>Try not to get your leather belt very wet. If you do, let it dry naturally away from direct heat like a radiator.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step">
                        <h3>Clean it Gently</h3>
                        <p>Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe off any dirt or dust.</p>

                    <div class="step">
                        <h3>Store it Properly</h3>
                        <p>When you are not wearing it, hang your belt or roll it loosely. Do not fold it sharply, as this can cause cracks.</p>

                <h2>What Makes a High-Quality Belt?</h2>
                <p>Not all belts are made the same. A cheap belt will crack, lose its shape, and look old quickly. A high<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hjQKOJTytgn6TDygceCDaTV4a1cXQgM5ST2jMV5t7HM/edit?gid=0#gid=0">-</a>quality belt is an investment. It will last for many years and still look great.</p>
                
                <p>Here are the things to look for:</p>

                    <div class="feature">
                        <h3>Genuine Leather</h3>
                        <p>The belt should be made from 100% genuine leather. Real leather is soft and strong. It also develops a beautiful patina over time. This means it gets a unique, richer look the more you wear it.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature">
                        <h3>Strong Stitching</h3>
                        <p>The contrast stitching should be tight and even. This is not just for looks. Strong stitching holds the belt together and makes it durable.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature">
                        <h3>A Good Buckle</h3>
                        <p>The buckle should be made of solid metal, like brass. A brass buckle will not rust or lose its color easily. It should also have a secure mechanism to keep the belt in place all day.</p>
